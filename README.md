# Clicky-Game


//Notes for the homework assignment: 
    //use activity 24, 28, 29 to help with this assignment.
    //Math.random to get the images to appear randomly every single time. 
    //instead of remove when click, you need to use the true false attribute to see if it has been clicked already.
